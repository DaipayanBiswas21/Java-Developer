During my project work, I actively applied SQL skills to design and manage structured data using the collegedet database. I created and manipulated multiple relational tables such as student, teacher, and customerinfo, ensuring data accuracy using primary keys and foreign key constraints. This experience gave me a solid understanding of how normalized schemas maintain data integrity in real-world systems.

I executed complex ALTER TABLE operations to modify column names, data types, and default values. This not only refined the table structure but also prepared me for dynamic database changes in a production environment. Using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, I worked with realistic datasets to simulate CRUD operations essential in any enterprise application.

My query-building experience includes diverse SELECT statements with WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, LIMIT, and ORDER BY clauses. I applied aggregate functions (MAX, AVG, COUNT) along with GROUP BY and HAVING to derive meaningful insights like average marks by city and student performance filters. These skills mirror the analytics-driven needs of modern data systems.

Advanced SQL techniques like JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) were used to associate students with courses and employees with their managers, reflecting real business relationships. I also practiced creating views and subqueries for modular and efficient query handling.

This project not only sharpened my technical command over SQL but also enhanced my logical thinking, data organization, and problem-solving capabilities. These skills directly align with the expectations of Cognizantâ€™s DNP 4.0 program, where scalable data handling and efficient querying are critical.
