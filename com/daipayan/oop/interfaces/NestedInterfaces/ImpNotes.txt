Awesome question again! You're diving into **nested interfaces** — nice! Let's clear it up step by step:

---

### 🧩 Why `A.NestedInterface`?

When you write:
```java
class B implements A.NestedInterface
```

You're saying:
> "Class `B` implements the nested interface called `NestedInterface` which is **defined inside class `A`**."

---

### 🤔 But why is it accessed like `A.NestedInterface`? Is it static?

Yes — **nested interfaces are implicitly `static`**, even if you don’t write `static`.

### 🚨 Rule:
> **All interfaces declared inside a class or interface are implicitly `public static`**, unless marked otherwise.

That means:
- You can access `NestedInterface` using `A.NestedInterface` **without an instance of A**.
- It behaves like a **static nested class/interface**.

---

### 🔁 If it were a normal (non-static) inner class?
Then you'd need to do:
```java
A outer = new A();
A.NestedInterface inner = outer.new NestedInterface(); // if it were a class
```
But that's **not required for interfaces**, since they're already static.

---

### ✅ In short:
- `A.NestedInterface` syntax is valid because `NestedInterface` is implicitly `static`.
- You don’t need an object of `A` to implement or access it.

Let me know if you want to try converting this to a normal inner class to compare the behavior!
